# Welcome
Stationary BikeVR is a group project done for the Virtual and Augmented Reality class at the University of Stuttgart during the summer semester 2019.

## Project Description
The main focus of the project is to make exercising on fitness machines to be more appealing and fun through the combination with virtual reality. More precisely, we aim to equip a stationary bike with additional sensors whose measured data can then be utilized to act as input values for various VR applications. We are aware that making things more attractive through gamification does not represent a novel idea by any means. However, our project aims at being low-cost and openly accessible so third-parties can eventually profit from our results. Additionally, since the scope of the project covers many different aspects of software programming we also hope to gain further experience in these fields.
